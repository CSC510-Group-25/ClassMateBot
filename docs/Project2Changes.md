## Additions
### Question and Answer Commands
The new question and answer commands allow students to ask questions that are automatically numbered. Both students and instructors can answer the question which will be attached to the original answer. Please see [/docs/QandA](https://github.com/SE21-Team2/ClassMateBot/blob/main/docs/QandA) for more details.

### Review Questions Commands
The new review questions commands allow instructors to add review questions for students to use as a study resource. Students can get the questions in a random order and view the hidden answers whenever they are ready. Please see [/docs/QandA](https://github.com/SE21-Team2/ClassMateBot/blob/main/docs/ReviewQs) for more details.
